# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe game playable in the browser to demonstrate and test skills learned in Modular programming and Factory functions

Description

This application allows one or two players to play against either each other or against a computer.

The technologies used in this project are JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

I found the implementation of the AI module difficult and think that I will need to focus on implementation of Algorithms in the future. I still have some bugs to work through on this. i.e. If the player clicks a cell the opponent has already selected in AI mode, the game will break.

I hope in future to be able to allow the player to play as either 'X' or 'O' and for different difficulty AI's to be implemented.
